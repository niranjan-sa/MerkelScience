# MerkelScience Test Problems.

The code for the first two problems has been written in `MinSliceSumProblem.py` and `PositiveElementSearch.py` files.
The time and space complexities have been mentioned in the comments. I have tried to follow PEP 8 coding standard.
Please navigate to the `/tests` folder. It contains a script that covers various test cases for the above to code files.

Thanks.
