Horkabork,#21,1,"I don't think this forum needs registration date elitism. People already have enough excuses to insult and fallaciously disregard other people's arguments. We don't need people to think that the points of idiots are more valid or truthful just because they've been her awhile and we don't need people to think that new people are idiots and their opinions shouldn't be acknowledged just because they're new.,Jesus. This forum is scaring me. Usually, I'm the wackadoo on any particular forum, but lately I've been reluctant to post because I've been out-crazied. You know that you're insane when you see a hobo with crap-ridden pants backing away from you slowly.,Also, anyone who is ragging about free speech and censorship needs to understand that those principles don't apply in internet forums any more than they apply to me if I take a sharpie to your apartment walls. Those are governmental concepts. This forum is not run by the government. You have no right to free speech here only so much as they can't censor based on a user's characteristic of being part of a special group (E.G., you can censor me for being gay if I'm posting about bitcoins within guidelines that apply to non-gays).,This isn't even specifically about moderating offensiveness or spam, but relevance. Deleting someone's thread that says ""Sell sell sell"" is no different, in terms of free speech, from deleting a thread I might make featuring the entirety of the amino acid sequences for trypsin family proteases compared between various key animals so we might talk about concerted evolution with nary a mention of bitcoins.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.20

£,#25,1,"1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.,2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL"",3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.,4. No referral code spam,5. No NSFW content,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,These all sound reasonable to me, harmful but reasonable, number 1 is the most likely to be harmful to building the character of a robust community.,I can see any number of posts that would be worthwhile and add to the character of this forum (to any forum) yet would fall foul of many of these caveats.,For instance swearing is so culturally divisive that what might be seen as a genuine transgression by one person is simply humor (or more precisely 'humour') to another. From personal experience I know that - for example - Americans are can be offended by language that people from the UK are indifferent to, or even see as endearing, what to one person imbues a post with spirit and character to another renders it offensive.,But of course nobody wants to have to 'listen' to someone hurling unnecessary and unwarranted abuse at another poster, so there is a real need to keep a check on this kind of thing, at least to some degree.,I suggest you make a distinction between swearing per se and ad hominem, for example here are two examples . . .,. . . example A contains swearing yet is (to these ears at least) not in the least bit offensive, example B is pure ad hominem, likely to elicit a similar response and is corrosive to the conversation.,If on the other hand there is simply going to be a list of censored words then why not just use the BB software to track and change them, much like a US religious forum, so ',' becomes ',' - and 'no fucking way!' becomes 'no damn way'.,Personally I think this kind of thing is a move in the wrong direction, I am a member of a cycling forum in the UK that has zero moderation and the tone and sense of community is something even the best drawn up list of rules could not come close to, the forum has grown from nothing to 50,000 + and suffers none of the problems lists of rules like these seek to address.,It's fucking great !, ",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.20

From personal experience I know that - for example - Americans are can be offended by language that people from the UK are indifferent to, or even see as endearing, what to one person imbues a post with spirit and character to another renders it offensive.,But of course nobody wants to have to 'listen' to someone hurling unnecessary and unwarranted abuse at another poster, so there is a real need to keep a check on this kind of thing, at least to some degree.,I suggest you make a distinction between swearing per se and ad hominem, for example here are two examples . . .,A) Oh, for fuck's sake I can't believe they've increased their fucking charges for THE SECOND TIME in a freaking month!
